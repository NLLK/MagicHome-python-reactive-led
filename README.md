# MagicHomeReactiveLed
 
It supposed to be a project with separate small library for people who dont want to deal with mathmatic things to create their own "Equalizer" based reactive app for any reason. I thought make it easy to create such app but lack of time has killed this idea. So, if you some how managed to find this repository, contact me through "Issues" page or just create pull request if you want so for some reason. I am open for any kind of communication but will not publish any other contacts. Thanks for reading
